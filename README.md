# Digit_recognnition_SVM
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the MNIST digits dataset. It includes preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, model training, evaluation, hyper-parameter tuning, and saving the final model.  Achieved a Tuned Model Accuracy of 98.88% on the test dataset.
